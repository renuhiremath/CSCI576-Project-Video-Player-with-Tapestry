In this project, you will implement a video summarization algorithm that produces a “summary image” summarizing the video content. Furthermore, given a video and an audio file, you are required to design a user interface that can

• display the video/audio stream in synchronization and

• given the “summary image”, allows a user to interact with this summary image to appropriately jump to the correct location in the video in order provide an effective visual browsing interface.

With this interface, users should be able to quickly browse the video/audio content, and conveniently hone down on areas that they are interested in, quickly explore and hence efficiently determine whether the content is worth further viewing or watch only the relevant parts that interest them.
